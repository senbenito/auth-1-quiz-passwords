# About Passwords Quiz
## What I think about when I think about passwords.

### With your partner, in words both of you will understand 6 months from now, answer the following questions.

> What is identification?

A way to tell the site who you are.

> What is authentication?

A way to prove you are who you claim to be.

> What is authorization?

This is what you can access once identification is authenticated.

> What is your opinion on how identification and authentication are currently implemented in the industry?

Mat says, and we will agree, that the current paradigm is deeply flawed (id = email?!?; password = ASCII garbage?!?!?).

> What is your password?

Not today, Mat.

> If a customer asked for a set of rules for appropriate passwords, what advice would you give them?

Go for length, not special characters and crap. Use a simple sentence!

> What advice would you give loved ones for their own passwords?

As above, and: use a unique password for your email. Use a password keeper like LastPass. NEVER give your password to anyone claiming to need it (except me and your HBO Go password).
